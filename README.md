# Monte_carlo_simulations_logit_Project
 
This folder includes my code for one of the homeworks for Advanced Quantitative Methods Class. A full description of the task you may find in HW4.pdf. In this homework all linear and non-linear models were self-programmed (we haven't used any packages. First we built Likelihood function and then optimized it). 

In short, the fomework covers the following topics:

1. Logit, Probit, and the Linear Probability Model

2. Log-Log Model

3. Model Selection: self-programmed ROC curve 

4. Model Specification Issues and Monte Carlo experiment
